Question 5
What is a so called branch in Git terms and why would you use it?

When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas.
Changes you make on a branch don't affect the master branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes.
So the use of branches enables the feature to work together on a project easily.
